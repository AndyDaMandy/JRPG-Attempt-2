# Textia
Textia is an adventure RPG without images! The idea is a simple 3-party system, with items, spells, equipment, etc.

The game contains an "adventure" mode, where you go through and explore the world, open up shops, the usual! You can then enter dungeons, find items, and kill monsters!

It's a work in progress at the moment, but the fundamental battle system is working and is playable.

This game uses Simple Storage, for more information go here: https://github.com/ZaDarkSide/simpleStorage

Version 0.04, alpha build.
