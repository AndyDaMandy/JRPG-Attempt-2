# Textia
Textia is an adventure RPG without images! The idea is a simple 3-party system, with items, spells, equipment, etc.

The game contains an "adventure" mode, where you go through and explore the world, open up shops, the usual! You can then enter dungeons, find items, and kill monsters!

The game is finished. It could probably use some game balancing so if you have any thoughts on the difficulty, let me know!

This game uses Simple Storage, for more information go here: https://github.com/ZaDarkSide/simpleStorage
